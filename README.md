We carefully crafted the meta descriptions for each page, ensuring they are concise yet informative. These descriptions are optimized with our chosen keywords, offering a clear and engaging preview of our content. We regularly update these descriptions to reflect the latest offerings and changes on our site.

### Title

The title tag, located in our website's `base.html` template, is customized for each page to enhance our SEO efforts. This dynamic approach allows us to target specific keywords and improve our search visibility for various search queries.

### Relevant Content

To ensure our content is both search engine optimized and user-friendly, we integrated selected keywords into key elements such as H1 tags, meta data, product names, descriptions, and general text. This integration helps improve our search rankings while providing valuable information to our users.

### Sitemap

We created a comprehensive sitemap for GN-SHOP, allowing search engines like Google to efficiently crawl and index our website's content. This sitemap ensures that all relevant pages are easily discoverable.

- **[sitemap.xml file](https://github.com/wlia-code/ServeShop/blob/main/sitemap.xml)**

### Robots.txt

We configured the `robots.txt` file to manage which pages are accessible to search engines. This file blocks search engines from indexing non-essential pages like login and authentication screens, ensuring that only relevant content is searchable.

- **[robots.txt file](https://github.com/wlia-code/ServeShop/blob/main/robots.txt)** has a link for navigation.
