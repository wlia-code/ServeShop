## Project Description

**GN-SHOP** is an advanced e-commerce platform designed to provide users with an extensive range of products from various categories such as electronics, fashion, home essentials, and more. This platform facilitates a user-friendly shopping experience with advanced functionalities like product reviews, wishlists, and comprehensive order management.

## UX

### Goals

The primary goal of the GN-SHOP project is to demonstrate a robust and fully-functional online shopping platform built with Django. It showcases seamless integration of product listings, user authentication, and advanced features like wishlists and testimonials.

### Target Audience

- B2C (Business to Consumer) model,  the target audience is individual consumers who are looking for a convenient and varied     
  shopping experience from the comfort of their own homes or on the go. The platform is specifically designed to cater to the needs and preferences of end-users rather than businesses or wholesale buyers, focusing on direct sales through an accessible online store interface. This approach makes the platform suitable for a wide range of consumers, from casual shoppers to those seeking specific items for personal use.
